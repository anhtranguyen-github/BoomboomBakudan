# BoomboomBakudan Project Analysis Report

## Project Overview

BoomboomBakudan is a comprehensive real-time cryptocurrency data streaming and analysis platform. The system collects live cryptocurrency price data from Binance, processes it through a scalable stream processing architecture, and makes it available for analysis and visualization. Additionally, it incorporates a machine learning pipeline for price prediction.

## 1. SOLUTION QUALITY

### 1.1. Appropriateness of the chosen solution

#### Problem Formulation

The project primarily addresses the problem of **cryptocurrency price prediction**, formulated as a **binary classification problem** (whether the price will increase or decrease). This formulation is appropriate for the following reasons:

- **Practicality**: The system is designed to collect real-time labeled data (price movements) from Binance API, making it practical to implement a supervised learning approach.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: By leveraging publicly available API and open-source tools, the data collection cost is minimized.
- **Business value**: The prediction of price movements has clear business value for trading decisions.

#### Model Selection

The solution employs a variety of classification algorithms, which is appropriate for the formulated problem:

- **Ensemble methods** (RandomForest, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, CatBoost) - Well-suited for financial data with complex, non-linear patterns
- **Linear models** (LogisticRegression, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis) - Provide interpretability and baseline performance
- **Instance-based methods** (KNN) - Capture local patterns in price movements
- **Probabilistic models** (GaussianNB) - Handle uncertainty in price predictions

This diverse set of models allows the system to compare different approaches and select the best performing one, which is a sound methodology for this type of problem.

### 1.2. Rigor of the empirical evaluation

#### Evaluation Strategy

The project demonstrates a rigorous evaluation strategy:

1. **Time series split**: Properly uses temporal train-test splits rather than random sampling, which would be inappropriate for time-series data
2. **Cross-validation**: Implements k-fold cross-validation (n_fold=5) for robust performance estimation
3. **Multiple metrics**: Evaluates models using accuracy and includes timing metrics

#### Performance Measures

The solution uses appropriate performance measures for a classification task:
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall prediction correctness
- **Cross-validation scores**: Provides robust estimation of model generalization

#### Hyperparameter Tuning

The project includes a framework for hyperparameter exploration:
- Models are configured with specific parameters (e.g., n_estimators=25 for ensemble methods)
- The ModelEvaluator class provides infrastructure for comparing different model configurations

#### Model Comparison

The evaluation system includes:
- A comprehensive comparison framework for multiple models
- Visualization of model performance (boxplots and heatmaps)
- Detailed reporting of model metrics

#### Knowledge Discovery

The feature engineering component (TechnicalIndicators) extracts meaningful patterns from raw price data:
- **Moving averages** at different time windows (MA21, MA63, MA252)
- **Momentum indicators** (MOM10, MOM30)
- **Oscillators** (RSI, Stochastic)
- **Exponential moving averages** (EMA10, EMA30, EMA200)

These features represent established domain knowledge in financial technical analysis.
