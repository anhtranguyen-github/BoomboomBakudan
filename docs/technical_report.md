# BoomboomBakudan: Technical Report

## 1. System Overview

BoomboomBakudan is a comprehensive real-time cryptocurrency data streaming and analysis platform that implements a full data pipeline from acquisition to machine learning prediction. The system collects live price data from Binance, processes it through a scalable stream processing architecture, persists it in a NoSQL database, and leverages this data for price movement prediction.

## 2. Architecture

The system architecture follows a modern distributed streaming design pattern with the following components:

### 2.1 Key Components

1. **BinanceProducer**: Connects to Binance WebSocket API to capture real-time cryptocurrency price data and publishes it to Redpanda.
2. **Redpanda**: A Kafka-compatible message broker that handles the streaming data.
3. **BinanceConsumer**: Apache Spark-based streaming application that consumes data from Redpanda, processes it, and stores it in Cassandra.
4. **Cassandra**: NoSQL database for persistent storage of processed cryptocurrency data.
5. **Grafana**: Real-time visualization dashboard for monitoring cryptocurrency prices and system metrics.
6. **MLPipeline**: Machine learning pipeline that trains models on historical data and makes price movement predictions.

### 2.2 Data Flow

1. BinanceProducer connects to Binance WebSocket API and streams real-time OHLCV (Open-High-Low-Close-Volume) data.
2. Data is serialized using Apache Avro schema and published to Redpanda topics.
3. BinanceConsumer processes the streaming data in real-time using Apache Spark.
4. Processed data is stored in Cassandra database for persistence.
5. MLPipeline reads historical data from Cassandra to train predictive models.
6. Price movement predictions are generated and can be used for trading decisions.
7. Grafana visualizes both raw data and prediction results for monitoring.

## 3. Technologies Used

The system leverages a diverse stack of modern technologies:

| Component | Technologies |
|-----------|--------------|
| Data Collection | Python, WebSocket |
| Data Streaming | Redpanda (Kafka API compatible) |
| Data Processing | Apache Spark, PySpark |
| Data Serialization | Apache Avro |
| Storage | Apache Cassandra |
| Visualization | Grafana |
| Machine Learning | Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost |
| Containerization | Docker, Docker Compose |

## 4. Machine Learning Pipeline

### 4.1 Data Preparation

The MLPipeline transforms raw OHLCV data into a feature-rich dataset suitable for training predictive models:

1. **Data Loading**: Historical price data is loaded from Cassandra.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators are computed, including:
   - Moving averages (MA21, MA63, MA252)
   - Momentum indicators (MOM10, MOM30)
   - Oscillators (RSI, Stochastic)
   - Exponential moving averages (EMA10, EMA30, EMA200)
3. **Target Variable Creation**: Binary classification target (1 for price increase, 0 for decrease).
4. **Train-Test Split**: Time-series appropriate splitting to avoid data leakage.

### 4.2 Model Training

The system trains multiple classification models to predict price movements:

1. **Model Types**:
   - Ensemble methods: RandomForest, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, CatBoost
   - Linear models: LogisticRegression, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
   - Instance-based methods: K-Nearest Neighbors
   - Probabilistic models: Gaussian Naive Bayes

2. **Training Approaches**:
   - Baseline models: Trained using only OHLCV data
   - Full-feature models: Trained using all technical indicators

3. **Evaluation Strategy**:
   - K-fold cross-validation (n_fold=5)
   - Time-series splits to respect temporal nature of data
   - Performance metrics: Accuracy and timing metrics

### 4.3 Model Serving

Trained models are saved with comprehensive metadata and served through an API:

1. **Model Persistence**: Models are saved using joblib with detailed metadata.
2. **Model Selection**: Best performing models are selected for deployment.
3. **Prediction API**: Predictions are made available via a REST API.
4. **Periodic Retraining**: Models are retrained at configurable intervals to adapt to market changes.

## 5. Deployment Architecture

The entire system is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose:

### 5.1 Container Structure

- Spark streaming uses checkpointing for recovery
- Cassandra offers tunable consistency for reliable data storage

### 6.3 Performance Optimization

- Data serialization with Avro for efficient transmission
- Batch processing in Spark for optimal throughput
- Cassandra schema designed for time-series query efficiency
- ML models evaluated for both accuracy and prediction speed

## 7. Security and Monitoring

### 7.1 Security Considerations

- No API keys exposed in code or configuration files
- Containerized deployment for isolation
- Limited exposure of services to host network

### 7.2 Monitoring and Observability

- Grafana dashboards for system metrics and data visualization
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## 8. Development and Deployment Workflow

### 8.1 Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Start services using Docker Compose
3. Access monitoring interfaces (Redpanda Console, Spark UI, Grafana)
4. Develop and test changes in isolation

### 8.2 Deployment

The system can be deployed using Docker Compose or in a Kubernetes environment:

```bash
# Start the entire system
docker-compose up -d

# Scale Spark workers
docker-compose up -d --scale binance-consumer-worker=3

# Run ML training
docker exec mlpipeline python train_save_models.py
```

## 9. Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the system include:

1. **Advanced Models**: Implement deep learning approaches (LSTM, Transformer) for better sequence modeling
2. **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Add systematic hyperparameter optimization
3. **Model Explainability**: Integrate tools for model interpretation
4. **Financial Metrics**: Include domain-specific metrics like Sharpe ratio or profitability
5. **Feature Selection**: Implement more systematic feature importance analysis
